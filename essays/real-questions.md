## Questions in Academia
In our early days of education from K-12, the public school system encourages everyone to ask questions. As a complement to this standpoint, many teachers encourage students to ask questions and always do their best to answer the student. In an academic environment, this process is perfectly understandable; after all, teachers are driven to ensure that their students are understanding the material to the best of their ability. Students will ask questions good or bad, and the teacher will do their best to bridge the gap between the student and the information they are trying to understand.

## Questions in the Real World
While the student and teacher principle is great for learning, there is no teacher to guide you through every step of the way in the real world. Instead, if we're presented with a problem that we can't solve, we rely on the knowledge our peers are willing to share. Thankfully, the internet has evolved in a way that presented a way for hackers to question one another whenever necessary through StackOverflow.

## Questions in StackOverflow
StackOverflow has been around for nearly 9 years as of today, and through its lifetime a plethora of hackers have gathered together and shared their knowledge with one another. While StackOverflow is a great resource for hackers of any skill level to participate in, there are two key things to understand when formulating a question for other hackers to answer (we'll call questions that conform to these principles a "smart question").

### Good Questions
The first key component of a "smart question" is to ensure your questions are as clear as possible, providing any explanations or examples that help the viewers of your question gain a better understanding of what exactly you're asking. Take a question such as the one seen [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array) as an example. While the question itself (as seen from just the title) may be broad, the explanation provided information as to what s/he tried as well as possible lines of thought they had so viewers can digest this information to formulate an appropriate answer. This greatly improves the chances of a good answer being formulated as people are not stuck with the problem of needing to "question what the question is asking". The second key thing is to ensure you've done your share of work to believe it is necessary to ask this question in the first place. Essentially, this comes down to the question being specific enough where formulating a good search query for Google to process was not sufficient to answer your question.

### Bad Questions
So what happens when hackers don't conform with both of these components? If the second key component wasn't followed, the viewers of your question may be benevolent enough to do the googling for you and mark your question as a duplicate which turns your question into a redirection to a better question (or at least an older question with well established answers already). While this isn't all that bad, not conforming with the first key component is extremely bad (we'll cal this the "not so smart questions"). Take this question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27253305/c-types-not-matching) that has been "downvoted off the face of the planet". The question already sparks some questions for hackers, after all "types not matching" is a problem for C and it seems that this could be solved by simply "making the types match". Before getting ahead of ourselves, we can delve deeper into the problems with the provided explanation. While posting the error is good (allows hackers to see the errors per the compiler), the other part of the explanation is simply the entire code and "I ran this, it produced this error HELP!?". The author of the question does provide some thoughts he has on his own problem such as "Should my array be two dimensional?" although the problem with this is why hasn't s/he tried that if they've recognized that already.

## We All Need Some Help in the End
Good or bad, we have to start learning to ask questions from somewhere. The great part about StackOverflow is that it was designed to ensure that hackers could help other hackers learn to ask questions the smart way. In our "not so smart question" example, some hackers were kind enough to provide a "comment" as to how the author of the question could improve upon their question. Reputable hackers can also create modifications to a question to help viewers answer them with proper explanations. Learning to ask questions the smart way is a crucial skill; after all, no one can know everything about programming so being able to ask good questions in your time of need may pay off in the end.

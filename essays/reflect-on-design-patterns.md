# The Key to Multitasking
We face a lot of problems in our daily life, and ideally we'd like to deal with all of them all at once, and to the best of our ability. The human brain unfortunately, isn't very good at splitting its attention across multiple tasks at once. When faced with a variety of challenges, often times from a purely neurological standpoint, the best course of action is to complete a single task as long as possible and switch only when faced with a sizable hurdle that you feel that you cannot immediately overcome. On paper it's a simple concept, work hard at one thing until you can't do it anymore then switch focus to another task that seems manageable. Working through a single task often isn't a linear challenge however, it requires dividing up the work within a task into components that we can easily solve. In Computer Science terms, essentially the best approach to multitasking comes down to a divide and conquer approach, break down problems into small chunks that are easily solvable and slowly build up towards completion of the overarching task. Having a proper mental working process however, is only half the battle, the other half comes from structuring our tasks themselves in a way that accommodates for this approach.

# Problem Structure
Web Development takes a large amount of multitasking inherently. Whenever developing a product, it requires the usage of multiple technologies to effectively solve the problem to create a modern, professional product. To do this, using an optimal Design Pattern that suits the structure of the problem is a major player on the road to success. One Design Pattern that has proven effective in the road of Web Development is the Model-View-Controller pattern. The philosophy behind this design, is to separate the product into three clear components:
1. Model - The database of the system. All data flowing through the system is stored in a well-organized component within the codebase
2. View - The frontend of the system. Users interacting with the system are presented with certain pages that are well-presentable and appeal to the users
3. Controller - The handler of the system. Communication between the different components is handled through this part of the

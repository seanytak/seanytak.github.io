## Dynamic Language
Prior to this class, I had limited experience with JavaScript having only utilized it for two projects and without having formally learned the language. After going through the first module for JavaScript, I have come to appreciate much of the quirkiness of JavaScript most notably the extensive usage of anonymous functions. Be it bounding a function to a variable or passing it as a parameter, JavaScript is definitely stranger than any other programming language I've utilized. The flexibility of the way functions are handled in is a definite benefit to programming in JavaScript over other scripting languages like Python. Whether JavaScript is the best implementation of the programming language of the web is irrelevant; software engineers across the world have come to love JavaScript and developed an extensive ecosystem full of various libraries and frameworks that make JavaScript here to stay for the future of software development.

## Mildly Annoying
While most of the syntactical nature of JavaScript has been relatively similar to other languages, the small differences are somewhat annoying. Take the triple equals "===" for strict equality as an example, it's not a difficult change to adapt to but it is quite weird considering almost every other programming language utilizes "==" for the same expected result. Another set of weird differences is the usage of keywords "let" and "const" for proper variable declarations and the "for of" statement being the chosen syntax for an object-specific iterator rather than "for in" (backwards from Python which I prefer more in the "for loop" case).

## Learning Style
Athletic software engineering has been a wonderful approach to learning programming skills thus far. Practice Workout of the Days (WODs) are enjoyable and test basic understanding of JavaScript effectively. While the concept of a WOD can be stressful since tackling an unknown problem in a timed setting is never necessarily easy psychologically, the practice problems we've had thus far haven't been relatively challenging given the allotted time. The process of a WOD is always enjoyable as becoming accustomed to solving problems quickly is an extremely useful ability for a software engineer to have. Going forward, this learning style is definitely effective in improving upon my ability to work quickly and under pressure.

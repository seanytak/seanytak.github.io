## In your opinion, what are ethics?

Ethics are used to defend oneself for what they do in life.  People consider it as their ideas of principles, ways they decide to do certain things.  To me, ethics are different paths in choosing the direction you want your life to go in.  As I said in previous essays, one of the most important concepts to have in mind when becoming a software engineer is to have a sense of ethics, a way to figure out what is morally appropriate and what is unacceptable when it comes to society's standards.  There is a certain moral compass everyone must be guided by and follow in order to become a true developer.  A developer must learn to understand that there can be consequences as a result of each step they take. After all, no one would want to establish trust in someone who has a motto that "every man is for himself", correct?

## Having a say in your decisions:

After reading the excerpt "The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of", you should already automatically be able to understand that the developer was headed for the direction that he was in the wrong.  After all, he believed that what he created caused the girl in the article to commit suicide as a result of the side effects of the prescription.  He didn't even notice from the start that there was something wrong with the task he was assigned to, and therefore he still went through with it.  Because of this, he should be ashamed.  He has the chance to be ethical by refusing to complete the job and back out, but he went through with it, for "it was [my] job".  He had many chances to fix the issue, including the time the project manager tested the quiz and commented on the fact that each time it delineated to the prescription the client wanted to sell, the time when he read the requirements in the first place, even the time after the girl suicided, he could have redeemed himself and recieved the consequences of his actions.  It was also unethical of him to not mention anything about this event until 16 years later, as he stated in November of 2016 that this happened in the year 2000.

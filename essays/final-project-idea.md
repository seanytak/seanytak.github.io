# Overview
## The Problem
Over half of the items in the vending machines on campus are liked by absolutely no one. Based on what's left in the vending machine at the end of the day, it's clear to every student and the staff who restocks the vending machine what sells and what doesn't. Unfortunately, making changes to the vending machine will be at best, random, without input from the students themselves.

## The Solution
Introducing, Vending Vote, the democratic solution for UH Manoa students to get their favorite items inside of the vending machine. Staff will no longer be guessing as to what next hot item they should be putting for the week, now students will help the staff decide. The site will be simple, allowing students to upload an item along with a picture of that item. Before any new upload, students will be required to check if that item has already been posted. Students will vote for items in vending machines based on the building they are located in.

# Mockup Page Ideas
1. User Profile page
2. Login page
3. Admin Home page
4. UH Map (allows users to find the correct vending machines)
5. Search Page for Item already being voted on
6. Upload Page (allows users to upload new items)
7. Voting Page
8. Public Landing Page

# Use Case Ideas
1. New User goes to Public Landing Page, logs in, gets user profile page and sets their profile up, goes to UH Map page and selects their building of choice, alternatively goes to search page for items being voted on to get a feel for what other students are voting on.
2. Admin goes to Public Landing Page, logs in, gets admin home page, looks at items that are in the lead and notes them down to change the vending machines
3. User goes to Public Landing Page, logs in, gets user profile page, goes to UH Map page and selects their building of choice, alternatively goes to search page for items being voted on to get a feel for what other students are voting on.

# Beyond the Basics
1. Provide a data analyst page for the admins to use to track the top sellers and allows admins to make informative decisions that may be beneficial in the long run
2. Support the reviews for various items in the vending machines

<h1> Introduction </h1>
Hunter's Ground is a game developed in Java for the ICS 111 final project that placed 3rd in the class competition. For the final project, we had the option to create anything we wanted as long as we utilized the EZ.java library as the core of our project.

<h1> About </h1>
Hunter's Ground is a survival based game pitting the player against a horde of T-rexes. The objective of the game is to kill as many T-rexes in the allotted time without dying. For the project, I developed the player's controls, the weapons, the physics engine, as well as the various terrain elements. Along with the programmatic implementation of these features, I also custom made the artwork components for my parts using [Piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/).

<h1> Learning Outcomes </h1>
Hunter's Ground was a fun medium sized project that I was able to take from a planning phase to a full blown implementation of it. While programming it was moderately challenging, the larger lesson from the project was understanding how to slowly build a software project over the course of several weeks. From testing the weapons and the physics engine in their own environments, to letting the player run around in various simulations, building Hunter's Ground was a valuable experience to my development as a software engineer.

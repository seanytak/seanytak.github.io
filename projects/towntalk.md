<h1> Introduction </h1>
Town Talk was designed for the 2017 AT&T Hackathon. It is a web application that was designed as a model for a social network that small communities could utilize to create interpersonal interactions with one another. Small communities in the sense of Town Talk could range from a single apartment to an entire neighborhood.

<h1> About </h1>
Town Talk utilizes two main features, "Community Home" and "Community Groups". The idea behind "Community Home" was intended to be accessible by all members of a community but modifiable by whoever was designated as a community leader (owner of an apartment complex, political leaders of a district). Through this, they could post announcements and events pertaining to things relevant in their local community. The other feature "Community Groups" is usable by all members of the community and is intended to help individuals find mutual interests with each others within their designated area. Through this, Town Talk aimed to improve face to face interaction rather than separating online and offline interactions.

<h1> Learning Outcomes </h1>
Town Talk was my first experience building a web application. Prior to this, I had never worked with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript before let alone jQuery. Familiarizing myself with the DOM in the course of 24 hours was a very challenging process but in doing so I learned how to work quickly under pressure in a development environment. This was also the first large hackathon I had ever attended so adjusting to the environment of coding non-stop over 24 hours was a challenge in itself. Overall, it was a great way to push me out of my comfort zone and offered me exposure to the challenges of web development.

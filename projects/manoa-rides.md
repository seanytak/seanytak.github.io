# Carpooling Made Simple
Manoa Rides is an application that encourages and assists students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa to find potential carpoolers. Students can create a profile on the site, input their schedule, and list if they are looking to be a driver or a passenger. From there, their profile will be added to the database and listed on the search page. Manoa Rides is built on the philosophy that students are already comfortable with some form of social media, and will use our application to find potential carpoolers while using Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to contact them.  

# Development of the Project
Manoa Rides was developed by a three man team over the course of one month. I worked on the Front-End and Back-End design of the Home Page, Schedule Page, and the Profile Page.

# Learning Experience
The development of Manoa Rides was a solid learning experience of web application design. Each page taught me something new, with the Home Page being focused mainly on good Front-End design pushing my understanding of Semantic UI further with the Schedule Page on the other hand, enforcing deeper understanding of Meteor helper functions and events to create a well-structured form for submission. Understanding the technologies I was utilizing on a deeper fundamental level allowed me to develop the application much smoother the further I went along in the project. Most importantly, this project gave me a solid foundation in the incorporation of utilizing Software Engineering paradigms to smoothly develop an application within a team. Making informed decisions with my team members while we each individually contributed to the project over the course of the one month of development was an invaluable learning experience. Through this project, I realized that learning modern technologies is not the most important part of being a good developer, it's about being able to work with a team to incrementally build a project and knowing when to solve problems as an individual or when you should solve them together with your team.
